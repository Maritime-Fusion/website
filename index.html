    <p>
      Breakeven fusion is coming soon, but the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) reactors will be costly, 
      high maintenance, and have low capacity factors, leading to 5–10× higher electricity cost on the grid. 
      These reactors also face significant physics challenges for steady-state operation, such as managing first wall 
      heat flux and mitigating nuclear activation of structural components that may require Nobel-worthy breakthroughs to solve.

    <p>
      We’re building a reactor for marine applications that alleviates the challenges that arise between breakeven and a 
      commercially viable energy source. The market we’re targeting requires 15× less power, lower up-time, and costs 
      the same as alternative fuels but without any emissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since fusion does not use highly radioactive fuels or materials – unlike fission – we sidestep the vast majority of 
      regulatory challenges and safety risks associated with nuclear energy.
